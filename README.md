# Welcome to my *FAKE* conspiracy site!

This site is for an overly elaborate Halloween costume! My spouse and I are being conspiracy theorists, and I thought it  would be fun to have a dummy site to force on people filled with crazy conspiracies and theories. To get the millage out of this site I plan to turn it into a campaign site for a tabletop RPG called Monster of the Week (it's super fun, so you should check it out).


# Build

This site is built with what I call a "dangling" back-end, meaning it is set up to support future back-end features like a database. As stated before, I plan to expand on this project later on. Look for new, fun expansions as I work! Did I mention this site is full of fake theories and conspiracy points that you shouldn't take seriously? I did? Good!
